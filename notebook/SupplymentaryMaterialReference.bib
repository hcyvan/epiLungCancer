	abstract = {Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) is the gold standard for studying genome-wide DNA methylation. We developed MOABS to increase the speed, accuracy, statistical power and biological relevance of BS-seq data analysis. MOABS detects differential methylation with 10-fold coverage at single-CpG resolution based on a Beta-Binomial hierarchical model and is capable of processing two billion reads in 24 CPU hours. Here, using simulated and real BS-seq data, we demonstrate that MOABS outperforms other leading algorithms, such as Fisherâ€™s exact test and BSmooth. Furthermore, MOABS analysis can be easily extended to differential 5hmC analysis using RRBS and oxBS-seq. MOABS is available at http://code.google.com/p/moabs/.},

	abstract = {Next-generation methylation-aware sequencing of DNA sheds light on the fundamental role of methylation in cellular function in health and disease. These data are commonly represented at a single CpG resolution, while single-molecule fragment-level analysis is often overlooked.Here, we present wgbstools, an extensive computational suite tailored for methylation sequencing data. wgbstools allows fast access and ultra-compact anonymized representation of high-throughput methylome data, obtained through various library preparation and sequencing methods. Additionally, wgbstools contains state-of-the-art algorithms for genomic segmentation, biomarker identification, genetic and epigenetic data integration, and more. wgbstools offers fragment-level analysis and informative visualizations, across multiple genomic regions and samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.WGBSwhole-genome bisulfite sequencingRRBSreduced representation bisulfite-sequencingEM-seqenzymatic methylation sequencingDMRdifferentially methylated regionsDMBdifferentially methylated blocksPCRpolymerase chain Reaction},
