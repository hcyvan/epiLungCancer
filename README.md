# epiLungCancer

This project houses the source code for our research on lung cancer methylation.
Alongside data processing scripts, it encompasses one sub-project:

- [methytools](./methytools): Developed for processing BS-seq methylation data.

This project is designed to potentially serve as independent entities
in the future.

## Dependence
- [easyepi](https://github.com/hcyvan/easyepi): R packages that need to be installed

## Usage
### Configuring the data directory

copy config.yaml.tpl to config.yaml and complete the configuration according to
the local environment

## Code Description
+ [R/subtype_specific_dmc_dmr.R](./R/subtype_specific_dmc_dmr.R): R script about subtype-specific DMCs and DMRs
