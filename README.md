# epiLungCancer

This project houses the source code for our research on lung cancer methylation.

## Dependence
- [easyepi](https://github.com/hcyvan/easyepi): R packages that need to be installed
- [methytools](https://github.com/hcyvan/methytools): Tools for processing BS-seq data

## Usage
### Configuring the data directory

copy config.yaml.tpl to config.yaml and complete the configuration according to
the local environment

## Code Description
+ [R/subtype_specific_dmc_dmr.R](./R/subtype_specific_dmc_dmr.R): R script about subtype-specific DMCs and DMRs
+ [R/vector.R](./R/vector.R): R script about methylation vector analysis
