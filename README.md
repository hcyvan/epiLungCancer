# epiLungCancer

This project houses the source code for our research on lung cancer methylation.
Alongside data processing scripts, it encompasses two distinct sub-projects:

- [methytools](./methytools): Developed for processing BS-seq methylation data.
- [easyepi](./easyepi): Houses commonly used R methods in epigenetic research.

These projects are designed to potentially serve as independent entities
in the future.

## Usage
